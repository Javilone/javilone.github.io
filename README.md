# Personal Github Pages website: Portfolio.
👨🏻‍💻 Repository for my own portfolio. Here is the entire code of my portfolio.
GiHub Pages has a limit for the website to be a static site. This means: no server, no back end. So, sorry for the inconvenience. 

<h2>The state of the site. (7 march 2024).</h2>

<p>The site template is done! I'm updating it frequently (almost every day/two days) to fix some minor bugs, and minor details.</p>

<p><br>I've added the <b>"Responsive Web Design"</b> projects from the certification with the same name at freeCodeCamp.</p>
