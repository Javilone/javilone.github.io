                <header><h3>Responsive Web Design</h3></header>
                <p><br>In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I'm learning the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.</p>
                <p><br>First, I created a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, I mastered modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin and learned best practices for accessibility by creating a quiz site.</p>
                <p><br>Finally, I acquired the skills to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by developing a photo gallery with Flexbox and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.</p>
                <code><br>And, of course, I created this entire portfolio myself! </code>

                <header><h3>JavaScript and Java</h3><br><br></header>
                <p><br>Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.</p>
                <p><br>In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, I'll learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.</p>
                <p><br>I'll also learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.</p>
                <code><br>I will start this certification any time soon after this project!</code>

                <header><h3>Front End Development Libraries</h3><br><br></header>
                <p><br>Once I were familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'll level up my skills by learning some of the most popular front end libraries in the industry.</p>
                <p><br>In the Front End Development Libraries Certification, I'll learn how to style a site quickly with Bootstrap. I'll also learn how to add logic to my CSS styles and extend them with Sass.</p>
                <p><br>Later, I'll build a shopping cart and other applications to learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and Redux.</p>
                <code><br>I cannot see what I could do once I finish up this.</code>

                <p><br>Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.</p>
                <p><br>In the Data Visualization Certification, I'll build charts, graphs, and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.</p>
                <p><br>I'll also learn about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and how to work with data online using an API (Application Programming Interface).</p>
